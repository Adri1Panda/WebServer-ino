# WebServer-ino
Improving Arduino Ethernet WebServer example to bring navigation and dynamisation of web pages

2023/01/30 Initial state
  Starting from this case study : https://startingelectronics.org/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial/SD-card-web-server/ (all parts are interesting to read). Improving by allowing navigating through several pages, loading images/icon... by parsing HTTP requests

TO BE IMPROVED :
  - Sending CSS files
  - Using AJAX to provide dynamic datas from/to the arduino to/from the webpages (that is discussed later in the https://startingelectronics.org/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial
